## App02 TicketMachine
### Description
This app is a simple simulation of a ticket machine where the user enter real money and is able to purchase a ticket
### Requirements
Edit your copy of **App02-ticketmachine** as a starting point and make it more realistic by offering tickets to three local stations
1. Aylesbury costing £2.20
2. Amersham costing £3.00
3. High Wycombe costing £3.30</br>
### Features
1. Each ticket should have a destination, a cost and the date purchased.  
2. Print all available Tickets
3. Select one of the Tickets to buy
4. Add methods to the TicketMachine so that a user can insert 10p, 20, £1.00 and £2.00 coins.  
5. After each coin is inserted the machine should display the amount entered and the current balance.
### Required Testing
Create a TicketMachine and use it to purchase all three tickets.  Make sure that your tests include trying to purchase a ticket with too little money inserted, and also with too much money inserted.  Show that excess money can be refunded.  Use the terminal window to record your tests.

### Additional Java Concepts
YOU CAN GET A FIRST CLASS MARK (80%) FOR FUNCTIONALITY WITHOUT USING THE CONCEPTS BELOW IN App02.  
However the following concepts are a better way of implementing some of the TicketMachine's functionality, and if used will gain you a further 20%.
#### Constants
Whenever you have values in a program that are not going to be changed, it is better if they are defined as constants, in Java that can be done by defining them as **static final**
~~~java
  public static final Ticket AYLESBURY_TICKET = new Ticket("Aylesbury", 200);
~~~
This concept is not introduced until Chapter 5 in BlueJ, and you can use a variable instead.  In the next Chapter 3 they use literals, 60 and 24.  Although in this case they may be instantly recognised, constants like MINUTES_IN_HOUR and HOURS_IN_DAY make the program clearer and easier to read.
#### Dates
There is a Date data type in Java in the java.util package which can be used as shown below, but for simplicity you can simply use a String e.g. "15/Sep/2020" as this concepts is not covered in BlueJ.
~~~java
    import java.util.Date;
    ...
    private Date today = new Date();
~~~
By creating a new date, the variable will contain today's date.
In order to print out a date in the correct local date form you will need a SimpleDateFormat
~~~java
    import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
    ...
    private SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MMM/yyyy");
    ...
    String date = formatter.format(currentTicket.getDate());
~~~
#### Enumerations
Whenever you have a piece of data that only has a limited range of values, an enumeration is the best way to go.  So for example you could define Coin as where P10 has a value of 10, and P20 a value of 20.  Without the values in parenthases the values are numbered 0,1,2,3 etc.
~~~java
    public enum Coin
    {
        P10 (10),
        P20 (20),
        P100 (100),
        P200 (200);

        private final int value;

        private Coin(int value)
        {
            this.value = value;
        }

        public int getValue()
        {
            return value;
        }
     }
~~~
This concept is introduced in Chapter 6 of BlueJ
